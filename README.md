# YelpCamp
Web application that allows users to upload campgrounds as advertisements. 
Hello This is a project that I worked through in an online bootcamp to learn a full stack development cycle. 
This app allows users to upload, find, and discuss campsites. 
It utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Heroku.
The app is hosted at https://desolate-sands-12100.herokuapp.com/campgrounds
